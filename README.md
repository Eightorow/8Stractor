# How to Obfuscate and Run Your Script

To ensure your Python script is obfuscated and can be safely executed by others, follow these steps:

## 1. Obfuscate Your Script

- **Drag and Drop**:
  - Simply drag and drop your script file onto the `8Stractor.py` script.
  - This will create an obfuscated version of your script with the `.py8s` extension in the same directory as your original file. For instance, if your original script is named `example.py`, the obfuscated file will be `example.py8s`.

## 2. Distribute the Files

- **Send Both Files**:
  - Provide both the obfuscated `.py8s` file and the `Run 8s.py` script to your friends.

## 3. Running the Obfuscated Script

- **Execution**:
  - Your friends should execute the `Run 8s.py` script on their system.
  - They will be prompted to input the **directory** where the obfuscated `.py8s` file is located. This must be the full path to the directory, not the file itself.
  - They will also need to type the **file name** of the obfuscated script (without the `.py8s` extension).
  - The script will then handle running the obfuscated file using the provided directory and file name.

### Example

1. **Obfuscate**:
   - Original script: `example.py`
   - Obfuscated output: `example.py8s`

2. **Distribute**:
   - Files to share: `example.py8s` and `Run 8s.py`

3. **Run**:
   - **Directory**: `C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\`
   - **File Name**: `example.py8s`

The `Run 8s.py` script will execute the obfuscated file from the given directory using the specified file name.
